# FinalProject

This is my project. It is a program to track depreciation for numerous assets that an individual might account 
for (business-use, most likely). It is simple, but it allows the user to add and remove assets to a list, entering information that would be needed for a business owner (description, depreciation method, etc.). This program allows the user to depreciate assets with the 3 most common methods: straight-line, double-declining balance, and units of production.

This program is very relevant to my major (accounting), and therefore has actually helped me better understand both principles of computer science as well as accounting.
